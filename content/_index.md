Hey! I'm **lurk**, and welcome to my little Internet corner!<br><br>
I'm into systems and computer networks, with a strong interest in cloud computing. <br><br>I'm also a forex and futures trader, always keeping an eye on price action and market behavior — that's the part I find most fascinating.<br><br>
Privacy matters a lot to me and I'm a big fan of **_{{< blanklink  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" title="open source" >}}_**, the Linux kernel and the Apple ecosystem.<br><br>
I like to keep things clean, functional, and efficient — whether it's in my workflow, my setups, or the way I trade.

## \*nix stack I enjoy

- **RHEL** (rock solid)
- **Debian** (minimal and classic)
- **FreeBSD** (clean and powerful)
- **openSUSE** (underrated gem)
